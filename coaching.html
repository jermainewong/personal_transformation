						<p>Changing the world means exercising authenticity, integrity and compassion, raising awareness and taking positive action as appropriate. <br><br>This should be an inspiring and creative process, yet before long the cumulative effects of stress can take their toll, and habits of over-work and negative thinking begin to set in.</p>

						<h3>How can coaching help?</h3>
						<p>Coaching is a professional, collaborative process which helps you to <b>access your inspiration</b> and <b>maximize your potential</b>.<br><br> 
						<b>Evidence shows that coaching helps clients achieve results much more quickly than if they were working on their own.</b><br><br>
						Through a process of active listening, open questioning and ongoing support, the coach acts as a catalyst for you to clarify your values and desires, and achieve positive results in any area of your life, including career, relationships, health and personal development.</p>
						<h3>Our Approach</h3>
						<p>Our unique, integrated approach combines top-class coaching with groundbreaking energy alignment techniques to help you discover your own solutions to your challenges.<br><br>
						 You will learn powerful ways to release stress, clear negativity and find fulifilment at both personal and professional levels.</p>
						<h3>How are we different?</h3>
						<p>Traditional coaching places emphasis on goals and actions. Any personal challenges, including fears or limiting beliefs, are addressed along the way.<br><br> 
						While this may be helpful, these challenges are often not dealt with effectively and they may re-emerge, even after the coaching relationship has ended.<br><br>
						A horizontal, goal-based focus may also reinforce a sense of 'delayed gratification' where clients fail to find fulfilment and happiness in the present.
						<b>At PTGC we focus on the vertical as well as the horizontal - the art and science of 'being' as the essential foundation for the 'doing'.</b><br><br>
						Clients find it easier to identify and achieve their aims as a natural consequence of this state. And the step-by-step nature of the process becomes just as enjoyable as the end result.</p>
						<h3>How does it work?</h3>
						<p>Our coaching is transformative as it provides direction and clarity in an uncertain world where it feels like we have to paddle ever faster just to stay afloat.<br><br>
							As working hours stretch, time for reflection seems to shrink, thinking becomes clouded and our goals, dreams and desires are obscured. Before long we feel as if we are facing upstream.<br><br>
							<b>The solution</b> lies in building in regular sessions for creative thinking and reflection which provide the basis for making clear choices and taking concrete action.<br><br> 
							Alongside our powerful energy alignment training, this will always lead you downstream as you enter the natural flow of your life.</p>
						<h3>What are the benefits?</h3>
						<p>You will soon begin to feel a sense of fulfillment and success, however you choose to define it. And since all sustainable change starts from the inside out, you may even be inspired to discover new ways to meet your values and achieve your goals!</p>
						<h3>Our Programs</h3>
						<p>Clients may book a series of 4,8 or 12 personal transformation sessions according to need and preference. Each session lasts 60 minutes, and is conducted face-to-face or over Skype. With a good Internet connection, clients may therefore benefit from our programs wherever they are based in the world.</p><br>
						<p>Please contact us directly for free initial consultation or further information about our programs.</p>

						<h3>What others are saying</h3>
						<p>"Mark has a wealth of insight into the NGO world and the psyche of NGO workers that enriched our discussions and deepened my thinking of my own activist path. Mark's approach which combines energetic techniques with coaching was very effective.... I gained way more from the coaching than I had hoped and a lot of this is due to Mark's unique talents and experience" <i><b>Iris Cheng, Human Rights & Environmental Activist.</b></i></p>
