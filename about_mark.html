						<h3>From human rights to human potential</h3>
						<p>I set up PTGC because I am passionate about the power of human potential to create positive change.<br><br>
						I was initially able to fulfil these values as a human rights researcher and campaigner for Amnesty International. But after ten years, I realised it was time for a change. 
I discovered my fascination for coaching during a career break from this role when I was travelling around Asia. <br><br>
						My interest was initally sparked by joining a Reiki course in Thailand - mainly because I was open to doing something new and keen to explore a more spiritual approach to life. I also felt a strong connection with my Reiki teacher, Judith Ahnika Paul, who has since become a close friend.</p>
						<h3>Bridging science and spirit</h3>
						<p>With my professional background in human rights research, analysis and law, I felt a high degree of skepticism at first. But by learning to quieten my 'monkey mind', I soon discovered an energetic alignment that felt new, powerful and exciting! <br><br>
						This put me on a fast-track towards identifying new goals in my life and releasing the accumulated stress of working for over ten years in the human rights field.<br><br>
						On a short trip to Singapore, I met Helen Lee (Hyperlink: www.leeheiss.com) who introduced me to the world of coaching. She soon became my own coach, mentor and friend.<br><br>
						I began to discover a growing fascination with scientific research which supports a more 'inside-out' view of life where our inner state plays a key role in creating our external experience. 
</p>
						<h3>A heart-based approach to rights-based advocacy</h3>
						<p>I became increasingly aware that those working for external change must be equally attentive to their inner state in order to create sustainable, positive results for themselves, their organizations and the world at large.<br><br>
						Yet the external focus of their work combined with their sense of service on behalf of others can often lead to neglect of personal needs, desires and well-being.<br><br>
						My clients come from all walks of life, but many work for social change in governmental, charity or humanitarian organizations. While it may match their values, their work often generates a high level of stress which compromises balance and enjoyment of life.<br><br>
						<b>By taking an integrated approach that harnesses the intuitive power of the heart as well as the analytical skills of the brain, I catalyse a shift in my clients that helps them release negativity, think creatively and achieve their deepest desires - personally and professionally.</b></p>
						<h3>Bridging Asia and Europe</h3>
						<p>I was born in the UK but have lived and worked in Asia for ten years as a human rights researcher, business owner and coach.<br><br> 
						I hold a Cerficate in Leadership Coaching from Lee Heiss Coaching in Singapore and a Diploma in Personal Performance Coaching from the Coaching Academy in London.<br><br> 
						I am currently based in the beautiful valley of Pai in northern Thailand, but also make frequent visits to Europe, especially the UK and Spain. I facilitate group seminars and retreats as well as individual sessions in person and on Skype.<br><br>

						<h3>What others are saying</h3>
						<p>"Mark has a wealth of insight into the NGO world and the psyche of NGO workers that enriched our discussions and deepened my thinking of my own activist path. Mark's approach which combines energetic techniques with coaching was very effective.... I gained way more from the coaching than I had hoped and a lot of this is due to Mark's unique talents and experience" <i><b>Iris Cheng, Human Rights & Environmental Activist.</b></i></p>
