						<h3>My journey...</h3>
						<p>As a child, I never really knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. All I knew was that I wanted to live in different countries. It was that clear, not just to travel but to live for a while in different places around the world. The only thing I really loved in school was learning languages, so I guess that set me up well!<br><br> It only recently occurred to me that I have fulfilled that dream, although I really don't feel I did much consciously to make it happen. Somehow the choices and opporunities just arose and I took advantage of them.<br><br> As a Coach, I've come to realise that this kind of passage through life is natural - making choices based on opportunities that emerge. If you are following your heart, doing what feels right for you at the time, you can never make the 'wrong' choice. <br><br> Sure, things may turn out differently from how you expect, but you will always be able to make new choices later on based on your learning. And when we start to see this process as a string of <i>choices and learning</i> rather than <i>make-or-break decisions</i>, we can relax into the moment and go with the flow.</p>
						<h3>From human rights to human potential</h3>
						<p>I set up PTGC because I am passionate about the power of human potential to create positive change.<br><br> At first I was able to fulfil these values as a human rights researcher and campaigner for Amnesty International. This work took me all over the world interviewing victims of human rights violations, speaking at seminars, doing media interviews etc. I learned and achieved a huge amount in the process, but after ten years I knew that it was time for a change. <br><br>I discovered my fascination for coaching during a career break from this role when I was travelling around Asia. <br><br>My interest was initally sparked by joining a Reiki course in Thailand - mainly because I was open to doing something new and keen to explore a more spiritual approach to life. I also felt a strong connection with my Reiki teacher, Judith Paul, who has since become a close friend.</p>
						<h3>Bridging science and spirit</h3>
						<p>With my 'left-brain' background in human rights law, I felt a high degree of skepticism at first. But by learning to quieten my 'monkey mind', I soon discovered an energetic alignment that felt new, powerful and exciting! <br><br>This put me on a fast-track towards identifying new goals in my life and releasing the accumulated stress of working for over ten years in the human rights field. I also began to see how I could fulfil the same values by working with individuals in a different capacity. <br><br>On a short trip to Singapore, I met Helen Lee (Hyperlink: www.leeheiss.com) who introduced me to the world of coaching. She soon became my own coach, mentor and friend. <br><br>I began to discover a growing fascination with scientific research which supports a more 'inside-out' view of life where our inner state plays a key role in creating our external experience. I have come to believe that the growing overlaps between scientific inquiry and spiritual wisdom will revolutionise the way we live our lives and experience the world. </p>
						<h3>A heart-based approach to rights-based advocacy</h3>
						<p>I also began to realise that those working for external change must be equally attentive to their inner state in order to create sustainable, positive results for themselves, their organizations and the world at large.<br><br>Yet the external focus of their work combined with their sense of service on behalf of others can often lead to neglect of personal needs, desires and well-being. <br><br>My clients come from all walks of life, but many work for social change in governmental, charity or humanitarian organizations. While it may match their values, their work often generates a high level of stress which compromises balance and enjoyment of life.<br><br>By taking an integrated approach that harnesses the intuitive power of the heart as well as the analytical skills of the brain, I catalyse a shift in my clients that helps them release negativity, think creatively and achieve their deepest desires - personally and professionally. </p>
						<h3>Bridging Asia and Europe</h3>
						<p>I was born in the UK but have lived and worked in Asia for ten years as a human rights researcher, business owner and coach. I am currently based in the beautiful valley of Pai in northern Thailand, but also make frequent visits to Europe, especially the UK and Spain. I facilitate group seminars and retreats as well as individual sessions in person and on Skype.</p>
						<ul>
							<li> I hold a Cerficate in Leadership Coaching from Lee Heiss Coaching in Singapore and a Diploma in Personal Performance Coaching from the Coaching Academy in London.</li>
							<li>I am fairly fluent in Chinese and Japanese, and can hold a passable conversation in French and German. My Thai is gradually improving!</li>
