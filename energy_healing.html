						<p>In addition to our coaching programs, we also offer energy healing sessions which promote alignment at multiple levels: mind, body and spirit. These can be booked separately or as an integrated part of any personal transformation program.<br><br>
							Personal healing sessions generally last around 90 minutes. They begin with a brief introduction to the technique as well as a discussion on any issues the client wishes to highlight in advance. We then move into the treatment itself which usually lasts around one hour.<br><br>
							Mark Allison is a certified practitioner and instructor of Reiki <a href="www.markallison.org">(www.markallison.org)</a> and a trained practitioner of Craniosacral Biodynamics. <a href="www.integrated-cranial-workshop.com">(www.integrated-cranial-workshop.com)</a>. His approach to healing is informed by skills and experience gained through both of these modalities.

						<h2>What is Reiki?</h2>
						<p>Reiki, or 'universal life force energy', is an ancient art of hands-on healing. Reiki practitioners are able to channel universal healing energy to release blockages within the energy system that may result in physical, psychological or emotional problems. For many, Reiki provides a therapeutic antidote to the stresses and strains of modern life.<br><br> 
						The energy also helps to clear and strengthen the channel between head and heart, enabling clients  to develop a stronger connection with their inner guidance and sense of intuition. It can help those who feel somehow 'stuck' in their life or indecisive about which path to follow.<br><br>
						While closely linked with spiritual development, Reiki is not connected with any specific religion or belief system. 	
						</p>
						<h2>What is  Craniosacral Biodynamics?</h2>
						<p>Craniosacral biodynamics is the art of ‘listening’ to the physical body and inviting it to re-balance itself. The client lies on their back and the craniosacral practitioner places their hands lightly along the length of the spine from the sacrum to the cranium, observing and inviting any shifts necessary to bring about a more comfortable alignment.<br><br>
						Clients typically feel a sense of relaxation and often movement of tissues as the body takes the opportunity to release tension and stress.<br><br>
						The treatment can be effective for a number of physical disorders, including migraines, back and neck pain, nervous disorders and posture problems..  It can also speed the healing process for injuries as the body relaxes and healing fluids begin to flow. <br><br>
						Both modalities will clear any energetic blocks or physical imbalances that the client is ready to release at that time. This is typically felt as a sense of warmth, tingling or muscle twitching that may shift from place to place around the body. Blocks may also be lifted through emotional release such as laughing or crying. Clients usually feel a sense of deep relaxation or lightness at the end of the treatment. There is ample time for feedback on any insights gained during the session.

						<h3>What others are saying</h3>
						<p>"Mark has a wealth of insight into the NGO world and the psyche of NGO workers that enriched our discussions and deepened my thinking of my own activist path. Mark's approach which combines energetic techniques with coaching was very effective.... I gained way more from the coaching than I had hoped and a lot of this is due to Mark's unique talents and experience" <i><b>Iris Cheng, Human Rights & Environmental Activist.</b></i></p>
