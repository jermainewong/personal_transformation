						<p>I created PTGC because I am passionate about the power of human potential to create positive change. As a cerfified coach and energetic alignment practitioner, my passion is to help individuals around the world discover their passion and share it with others in positive, inspiring and creative ways.<br><br>
							With my professional background in human rights research and advocacy, I enjoy working with those who feel drawn to make a difference in the world. My clients come from all walks of life, but many work for social change in governmental, charity or humanitarian organizations. While it may match their values, this work often generates levels of stress which compromise balance, well-being and enjoyment of life.<br><br>
							I discovered my passion for coaching and energetics during a sabbatical break from my career as a researcher for Amnesty International. This put me on a fast-track of personal development to identify my dreams and desires and release the accumulated stress of human rights work, especially the adverse impact of working on a daily basis with individuals in distress.<br><br>
							I soon became fascinated with recent scientific research which supports a more 'inside-out' view of life where our inner state largely determines our external experience. By taking an integrated approach that harnesses the intuitive power of the heart as well as the analytical skills of the brain, I catalyse a shift in my clients that helps them release negativity, uncover their deepest desires and make their dreams a reality.<br><br>
							I was born in the UK but have lived and worked in Asia for ten years as a human rights researcher, business owner and coach. As a proficient linguist, I am able to provide guidance to clients in Chinese, Japanese, French and German as well as English.<br><br>
							I hold a Cerficate in Leadership Coaching from Lee Heiss Coaching in Singapore and a Diploma in Personal Performance Coaching from the Coaching Academy in London. Based in the beautiful valley of Pai in northern Thailand and Ibiza, Spain, I facilitate group seminars and retreats as well as individual sessions in person and on Skype.<br><br>

						<h3>What others are saying</h3>
						<p>"Mark has a wealth of insight into the NGO world and the psyche of NGO workers that enriched our discussions and deepened my thinking of my own activist path. Mark's approach which combines energetic techniques with coaching was very effective.... I gained way more from the coaching than I had hoped and a lot of this is due to Mark's unique talents and experience" <i><b>Iris Cheng, Human Rights & Environmental Activist.</b></i></p>
