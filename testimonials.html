						<p class="testimonial">I had a lot of trust and confidence in Mark from the start as we shared a similar NGO background and even worked together for some time. And he did a wonderful job. We enjoyed an honest and open relationship and this helped me to be comfortable about opening up. In turn, I became aware of some deeply rooted limiting beliefs which I was able to work on. Mark has a wealth of insight into the NGO world and the psyche of NGO workers that enriched our discussions and deepened my thinking of my own activist path. Mark's approach which combines energetic techniques with coaching was very effective. In particular it helped me release stress and some emotional baggage. I gained way more from the coaching than I had hoped and a lot of this is due to Mark's unique talents and experience. I feel really blessed with this experience!<i><b>Iris Cheng, Human Rights/Environmental Activist, Hong Kong.</b></i>

						<p class="testimonial">Mark was excellent at asking the right questions at the right time to get me to really think about the topic I had chosen to discuss. He helped to open up possibilities that wouldn't have occurred to me otherwise. I was really impressed by Mark's listening skills and the things he would pick up from my language. It was very insightful. I found the sessions well-structured and very effective at helping me to work out what I wanted and how to achieve it. I always ended our coaching sessions feeling highly motivated and inspired to do more and I really appreciated Mark's ability to hold me accountable for completing my action points. Overall I found the sessions enjoyable, useful, motivating and generally brilliant at helping me to move forwards in my life. Mark has all the attributes of a highly effective and successful coach. I would not hesitate to recommend him to others who are looking to be coached.<i><b>Shahira Moola, Yoga Instructor and Homeopathy Consultant, UK.</b></i>

						<p class="testimonial">I met Mark in Pai, Thailand and decided to take four coaching sessions with him because I was impressed by his ability to speak straight from the heart. Mark is a skilled and charismatic coach so I was able to identify and address my challenges in a very short time. Mark was able to guide me professionally through my issues. All I needed to do was relax and move more into my heart. This enabled me to talk through my problems and receive helpful insights. It is easy to follow Mark as he works with useful images and examples. It is especially helpful to receive his guidance on meditation and energetics - it really felt that we had a strong energy connection which helped the process along. After the sessions I always felt more relaxed with the power to move forward, and even now back in my daily life I really feel a sense of calm and peace of mind. I'd like to thank Mark for his outstanding support in reinforcing my ability to guide myself forward in my life!<i><b>Hannes Gresser, Factory Manager, Germany.</b></i>

Mark's approach came across as very encouraging, patient and sincere which made me feel empowered after talking to him each time.

						<p class="testimonial">My coaching sessions with Mark provided me with an opportunity to reflect on my life as a whole, identify aspects I was happy with and those I would like to change. It allowed be to think about how to make the first steps forward and make positive changes in my life. Perhaps, most importantly it has given me a sense of hope - a hope that you can make choices in life and that things can change for the better. As a result, I feel completely changed from how I was four months ago. I'm a lot more focused and clearer about how to achieve what I want. I am excited about future possiilities and even listening to music again - a huge passion of mine which I had lapsed out of.<i><b>Alex Boulton, Teacher, UK</b></i>
